(a)
  The main problem that the software will solve will be of faster and easier blood
  donation to the needy person. This is very important as for proper blood donation
  there must be a well operated mechanism, here this software.
  
  The main people that will be using the sofware will include the Hospital and the
  Blood Bank Staff members and the patients, to search for the available donor.
  The Blood Bank Staff will act as a bridge between the patient and the donor.
  
(b)
  This application is quite different from that of the existing ones as here the
  patients and the donors will be notified about on-going or future Blood
  Donation Camps via alerts on social media so that a blood donor can donate his/her
  blood that may be usefull for someone else.
